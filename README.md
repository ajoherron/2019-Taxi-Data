Notebook created to download, clean, analyze, and visualize data from The New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (NYC TLC). The majority of the analysis is for 2019's data.

Made for a final project for "Programming for Data Science" during Fall 2021. Created as part of a team (Abdulraham Binobaid, Beyza Kiper, Brian Reilly, Faleh Alshalwi).

Sections 3 and 4 have been commented out to avoid re-downloading the entire 8 Gb file for 2019 NYC TLC data.
